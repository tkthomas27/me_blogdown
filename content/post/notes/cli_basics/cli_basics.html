<!-- for more detailed overview see command line tutorial -->
<p>Before graphical user interfaces (GUI), drag and drop desktops, and voice activated assistances (e.g., Siri), the only way to interact with a computer was through written commands using the command line interface (CLI). Although you could be quite successful at using a computer without ever knowing what the CLI is, mastery of the CLI is that gateway to becoming a power user and unlocking the full potential of your computer. This is a quick overview of some command line basics as well as a few tips on how to make your experience more efficient (and cool).</p>
<div id="terminal" class="section level1">
<h1>Terminal</h1>
<p>To access the command line interface on macOS you need to open Terminal. It is located in <code>/Applications/Utilities/Terminal</code>; the easiest way to open it is to use spotlight (<code>⌘+space</code>) and simply type <code>terminal</code>.</p>
<p>An alternative to Terminal is <a href="https://www.iterm2.com">iTerm</a>. iTerm is a terminal emulator that can be used as a replacement for the native Terminal app. iTerm adds a host of new <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/features.html">features</a> that provided much needed productivity boosters like autocompletion and split panes.</p>

<h1>Basic Commands</h1>
<p>Below are a few basic commands that form the bedrock of command line interaction. If you ever have any questions about a command you come across, <a href="http://explainshell.com">Explain Shell</a> is an excellent resource as well as this <a href="https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet">cheatsheet</a>.</p>
<p>Before we begin, here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The term “directory” is just a way of referring to folders; “directory” is preferred on *nix operating systems as opposed to “folder” on Windows (checkout <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/169457/directory-vs-folder">this</a> for the super nerd answer)</p></li>
<li><p>The action that a command performs can be modified using flags. These are typically a “-” followed by a single letter. For example, to list the visible AND the hidden the contents in a directory you would type the list command <code>ls</code> followed by the flag <code>-a</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Creating Files and Folders</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>mkdir [dir_name]</code> make a directory</p></li>
<li><p><code>touch [file_name]</code> change file timestamps; easy way to create files</p></li>
<li><code>rm [file_name]</code> removes files (does not remove directories by default)
<ul>
<li><code>-r [dir_name]</code> remove directories and their contents recursively</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Moving Around and Exploring the Computer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>cd</code> traverse the directory structure forward (i.e., open a directory)</p></li>
<li><p><code>../</code> traverse the directory structure backward (i.e., exit a directory)</p></li>
<li><code>ls</code> list contents of current directory
<ul>
<li><code>-l</code> list detailed info such as permissions, owners, size, etc.</li>
<li><code>-a</code> list all contents including hidden contents</li>
<li><code>-S</code> sort</li>
<li><code>Sr</code> reverse sort</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>cp [file] [path]</code> copy source file to a destination</p></li>
<li><p><code>mv</code> rename source to destination or move source to a directory; whereas <code>cp</code> duplicates the file, <code>mv</code> only keeps one copy (either with the new name or in the new location)</p></li>
<li><p><code>grep [&quot;pattern&quot;] [file_name]</code> print lines matching a pattern</p></li>
<li><p><code>find [file_name]</code> find a file</p></li>
<li><p><code>cat [file_name]</code> display contents of file</p></li>
<li><p><code>echo [&quot;string&quot;]</code> display a line of text</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Useful Commands</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>sudo [command]</code> execute command as super user (requires password)</p></li>
<li><p><code>[command] | [command]</code> piping — feed output of one command into the input of another command</p></li>
<li><code>echo [&quot;string&quot;] &gt; [file_name]</code> overwrite file with string
<ul>
<li><code>echo [&quot;string&quot;] &gt;&gt; [file_name]</code> append file with string</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Text editors
<ul>
<li><code>nano [file_name]</code> a very simple text editor</li>
<li><code>vim [file_name]</code> a more robust and extensible text editor; type <code>esc</code> then <code>:q</code> to exit</li>
<li><code>emacs [file_name]</code> a more robust and extensible text editor</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="shells" class="section level1">
<h1>Shells</h1>
<p>While terminal is an application, the underlying software that you are using to do the command line interfacing is known as a shell. The default shell for macOS is Bash (Bourne Again Shell). Although Bash has stood the test of time, I currently using Zsh (pronounced Zee Shell) which provides useful features like command line completions, spell corrections, themeable prompts, etc.</p>
<!-- ## Bash -->
<div id="zsh" class="section level2">
<h2>ZSH</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get started with zsh is to install it using brew (checkout my other <a href="timothykylethomas.me/package-management">post</a> for instructions on how to use brew). To install zsh this way, simply type:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>brew install zsh zsh-completions</code></pre>
<p>To get the most out of zsh, you can try one of the several frameworks available. I am currently using <a href="http://ohmyz.sh">oh my zsh</a>. Oh my zsh gives you easy access to many useful <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins">plugins</a>.</p>
<!-- need post on how I customized my setup

# iTerm

split but can also use tmux

# Extras

`rtv`
`t`
other commands from brew (XX see package management for tips on Brew) -->
