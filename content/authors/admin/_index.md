Kyle Thomas does data analytics for fun and data wrangling for work. He has an education in the Study of Religion<sup>TM</sup> and work experience in finance and valuation. Kyle is a huge fan of R, visualization, and solving problems using analytics. He also finds it strange talking in the third person.
